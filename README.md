#### Abstract
> It's no secret that traditional silos between Dev and Ops can hinder productivity and innovation. But what about the silos that exist between DevOps engineers and teams? That's where Communities of Practice come in.
>
> Conway's law reminds us that the structure of a business can be reflected in its IT programs, and this often leads to data silos that can hinder progress. But fear not, Communities of Practice offer a solution by promoting generative work models, collaborative innovation and knowledge-sharing at scale.
>
> In this talk we will explore how the Amadeus DevOps Community went to learn from the CNCF and its community groups to grow an internal community of over 600 members, playing a crucial role in a vast DevOps transformation, enabling a large scale migration to cloud native and promoting upstream contributions to several CNCF projects
