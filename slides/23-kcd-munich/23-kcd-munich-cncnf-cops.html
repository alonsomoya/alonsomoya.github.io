        - Thanks everybody for being here
        - It is amazing to see how much the cloud native community has grown and how much we have grown together in barely a couple of years
        - And this very event is a good example of this. It is really amazing to see how a simple issue in github merely fueled by the enthusiasm of a bunch of volunteers can end up in an event like this one
        - Indeed in this session I'm going to talk about communities, and how you can grow your own in your organization
        - But, before we go to the meat of the talk, let me tell you a story...

<h2 id="org5965378">This is the story of Ted</h2>

<aside class="notes">
    - So, this is a story about Ted, a midjourney character by the way
    - Ted is a middle-aged sys-admin and self-proclaimed "infra nerd".
    - He's a cool guy, he likes spending time with family and friends, and goes to the office twice a week (only because he's forced to)
    - He works for an american scaled-up startup that has been into the field of distributed computing for about a decade now

<aside class="notes">
    - In more than a decade in tech, he's witnessed several revolutions, from mastering the dark arts of batch scripting to automate repetitive tasks,
    - .. to the fleeting craze of dealing with indentation issues in ansible playbooks, as he inevitably slowly becomes a full time YAML engineer
    - For years he's been working relatively confortably in a central team of sys-admins, loading software, patching servers and blaming DEVs for not testing enough their software and filling the /var/ filesystem with useless debug logs. Those people...

<p><img src="./pics/ted_scrum.png" alt="ted_scrum.png" />
</p>
</div>
<aside class="notes">
    - Ted's world changed when he was unexpectedly moved to a distributed agile team. Some manager in his company heard the word DevOps in a conference and he was moved to a virtual scrum where he gets to cloudify their applications
    - The day of Ted starts at 9 AM by attending the daily scrum. Ted's less favorite time of the day.
    - As he hears through the morning rants of his DBA colleague Rajesh whose tickets he barely understands
    - He reflects how good it was when sys-admins met for an informal morning coffee. Surely teleworking has paid a toll on him, as he feels more isolated, stressed and burnout than ever.

    - Ted's company decided some time ago to adopt Kubernetes, and with

<aside class="notes">
    - And the end of the week, Ted went to reflect about his current career development
    - Undoubtly as a curious engineered he enjoyed larning about development practices, pipelines and cloud, and his company loads faster and better, and he has enjoyed 
    - But what he was promised is that DevOps came to break down silos among Dev and Ops teams, when it reallity they ended up creating new ones between DevOps teams and engineers themselves
    - One day he decided to call his all sys-admin colleagues. It turns out every team has been doing a bit of the same in isolation and have heard different versions of the platform vision of their organization
    - Finally he decided to meet them next week for lunch, discuss how each of them is doing and talk about that he just heard to solve their dependency management issues: Renovate

    - It's a term conined already in the 90s by Wegner Taylor
    - And they represents a Group of people that share a passion or concern for what they do and interact regularly to make it better
    - Recently it has become very popular in the enterprise given the popularity of agile methodologies and multi-disciplinary teams
